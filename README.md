# HR-Attrition-Analysis-and-Report
This is the second project in my MeriSkill one-month virtual internship
#
In this project, I was provided with fictitious company employee data and was asked to perform preliminary data wrangling and then perform analysis to drive insight into why some employees left the company(Employee Attrition)
#
* Basis data wrangling with Python was performed on Jupyter Notebook. 
* Correlation analysis between all the numerical variables were carried out.
* A modern HR- Dashboard with the data was built on Tableau
* Statistical analysis - Chi-square test and One-way ANOVA Analysis to find out relationships between employee factors and attrition, and to find out the significant cause of employee attrition respectively were performed with SPSS version 25.
* A report based on these findings and recommendations on how to mitigate employee attrition to the human resource manager was built on Tableau.
